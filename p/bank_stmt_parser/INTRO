for za bank, statement is enough become it contains time deposit rows with date range info

but time deposit records can be duplicate! (appear repeatedly on statements of different months)

So you need to collect all records of td. (each one is a tuple of Principal+InterestRate+MaturityDate+MaturityAmount) And you need to do a `union` to remove duplicates for final sum.

Note all dates in za statements seem to follow format of strftime('%d%b%Y')
